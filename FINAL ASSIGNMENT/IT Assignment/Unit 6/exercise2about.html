        <p size=>We all love a solid pair of sneakers — from sports to runway to streetwear, some sneaker brands have become a cultural phenomenon, synonymous with culture. More than just a pair of shoes, sneakers are a go-to item for any occasion. But which brands are the best and what sneakers are in style in 2023?

            Moving between innovation and nostalgia, Nike Air Force, Air Jordan, Air Max, and adidas Superstar, and Stan Smith's — iconic silhouettes from the 70s and 80s — are probably deeply ingrained in our consciousness. After all, it was Nike and adidas that took sneakers from sports to fashion. Collectively making a casual $41 billion in 2021 from footwear sales alone globally, the two sports behemoths are still in the lead.
            
            But it isn't merely about revenues. Amid Kanye-adidas' beef and adidas' controversial decision to keep selling YE-less YEEZYs over billions of dollars in lost sales, fans haven't exactly approved. Don't get me wrong, the likes of Nike and adidas won't go anywhere anytime soon — they're still at the top of the list. But while it is relatively easy to pinpoint the two best sneaker brands, how do they stack up against others, performance, style, hype, and popularity-wise?</p>
